## Repo for Python Workshop on Data Analysis 9/22
## Downloading Python and setting up Jupyter
* Go to the [Anaconda site](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and download Anaconda for your operating system. Anaconda is a python distribution that includes packages like `jupyter` and `pandas` that we use in the workshop. I recommend download the Python 3.6 version
* Jupyter notebooks have the `.pynb` file extension like the one in this repository titled `python_workshop.ipynb`
* You can download this repository and then use the `python_workshop.ipynb` notebook as a starting point. You can follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for doing so. If you have experience with GitHub or would like to use it more, try cloning the repository; otherwise, just download the zip file
* After Anaconda installs, you can run the Anaconda navigator. You'll see a section called Jupyter Notebooks. Click 'launch' and it should open up in your browser. [Here's](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-with/9780134672618/DSPR_01_01_02.html) a video tutorial on how to launch it.
* If you need a refresher on how to use Jupyter, you can find it in the [documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html)
* Remember Google is your friend! I'd start with a more formal Python tutorial from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) to supplement the workshop.
